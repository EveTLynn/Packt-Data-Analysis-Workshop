# Packt Data Analysis Workshop
This is the repository of the Python notebook for each chapter in the book with my note, some with additional analysis and modeling (since the book do not cover machine learning).

Please prefer to this [link](https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-Data-Analysis-Workshop/tree/master) for the book official github which you can find their code for the exercises. 

As I've been reading the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow", I realized that I should have leave aside a part of the data for test set BEFORE doing any EDA or ML.
So if anyone may use my notebook for references, keep this in mind. I will only fix from chapter 7 onward.
