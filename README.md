# Packt Data Analysis Workshop
This is the repository of the Python notebook for each chapter in the book with my note, some with additional analysis and modeling (since the book do not cover machine learning).

Please prefer to this [link](https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-Data-Analysis-Workshop/tree/master) for the book official github which you can find their code for the exercises.
